# GraRep
Source Code of GraRep version 1.0

# Notice
1. You do not need impose L2 norm for embeddings again, or accuracy will be hurt. Actually normlization has been already done;
2. GraRep is suitable for undirected graph. If you want apply it for directed graph, please use matrix addition between adjacency matrix and its transpose to replace original adjaceny matrix before you run GraRep.

# Lisence
This code follows the MIT Lisence.
